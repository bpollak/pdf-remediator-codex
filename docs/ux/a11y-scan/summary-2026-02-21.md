# Accessibility Scan Summary
Date: 2026-02-21
Tool: `@axe-core/cli` 4.11.1 (Chrome headless)

## Pages Scanned
- `/`
- `/app`
- `/about`
- `/app/demo/compare`

## Automated Findings
- Initial scan:
  - `/`: 0 violations
  - `/about`: 0 violations
  - `/app`: 1 violation (`page-has-heading-one`)
  - `/app/demo/compare`: 1 violation (`page-has-heading-one`)
- Re-scan after fixes:
  - `/`: 0 violations
  - `/app`: 0 violations
  - `/about`: 0 violations
  - `/app/demo/compare`: 0 violations

## Fixes Implemented
1. Updated `/app` page heading to use `<h1>`.
2. Updated compare page heading to use `<h1>`.
3. Updated file report page heading to use `<h1>` for consistency across report routes.
4. Corrected heading hierarchy in compare sections so headings no longer skip levels.

## Manual Testing Still Recommended
Automated tools catch only a subset of issues. Run manual checks for:
- Keyboard-only navigation across upload, results, and compare actions.
- Screen-reader announcement order for readiness banner and checklist.
- PDF iframe fallback experience when previews are unavailable.
